Decade of experience working with teams in software design and development with a successful background in frontend, backend, relational databases, and enterprise applications. I am experienced in clearly defining requirements, using best practices to design the solution and the implementation of the code leveraging frameworks to reduce delivery time. My global work experience includes working locally with teams in Australia, Italy, Ireland, Puerto Rico, and with many companies across industry domains such as healthcare, process, aerospace and etc. My focus is to leverage my skillsets to be a technical evangelist to build compelling best in class new products.
